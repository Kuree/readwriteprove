                    <p>
                        This book, which is based on Pólya's method of problem solving, aids students in their transition from calculus (or precalculus) to higher-level mathematics. The book begins by providing a great deal of guidance on how to approach definitions, examples, and theorems in mathematics and ends with suggested projects for independent study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students will follow Pólya's four step approach: analyzing the problem, devising a plan to solve the problem, carrying out that plan, and then determining the implication of the result. In addition to the Pólya approach to proofs, this book places special emphasis on reading proofs carefully and writing them well. The authors have included a wide variety of problems, examples, illustrations and exercises, some with hints and solutions, designed specifically to improve the student's ability to read and write proofs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Historical connections are made throughout the text, and students are encouraged to use the rather extensive bibliography to begin making connections of their own. While standard texts in this area prepare students for future courses in algebra, this book also includes chapters on sequences, convergence, and metric spaces for those wanting to bridge the gap between the standard course in calculus and one in analysis.

                        "The book Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics (abbreviated RWP in this review) provides a fresh, interesting, and readable approach to the often-dreaded "Introduction to Proof" class. ... RWP emphasizes Pólya's four-part framework for problem solving (from his book How to Solve It). ... Beautiful examples of proofs containing the right mix of formalization and language are provided throughout the book. ... RWP puts a great deal of effort into casting the skill of constructing proofs as a problem-solving process. ... RWP contains more than enough material for a one-semester course, and is designed to give the instructor wide leeway in choosing topics to emphasize. ... This book has a rich selection of problems for the student to ponder, in addition to "exercises" that come with hints or complete solutions. ... I was charmed by this book and found it quite enticing."

                        "The book is well written and should be easy for a first- or second-year college mathematics student to read. There are many "tips" offered throughout, along with many examples and exercises of appropriate type and difficulty. ... A book worthy of serious consideration for courses whose goal is to prepare students for upper-division mathematics courses. Summing Up: Highly recommended."
